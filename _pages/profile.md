Hi! I am PhD student at the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Mount Stromlo Observatory, Australian National University (ANU) working with [Dr. Amit Seta](https://sites.google.com/site/amitseta90), [Prof. Christoph Federrath](https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~chfeder/) and [Prof. Matthew Kunz](https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~kunz/Site/Welcome.html). I completed my Bachelors and Masters degree at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Pune, India and obtained my BS-MS dual degree in 2020. I am orginally from India, growing up across many diverse regions of the country.

My research focuses on astrophysical turbulence, magnetic fields and the small-scale turbulent dynamo. I work on understanding magnetic field evolution in the collisionless hot intracluster medium of galaxy clusters using hybrid kinetic simulations. To do so, I have developed a hybrid particle-in-cell code within the FLASH code called "AHKASH". I have also worked on understanding the properties of the collisional magnetohydrodynamic small-scale turbulent dynamo in the low Mach number regime.

To read more about my research, please head to the [research](/RadhikaAchikanathChirakkara/research/) and [publications](/RadhikaAchikanathChirakkara/publications/) tab. You can find my [CV](/RadhikaAchikanathChirakkara/assets/pdf/Radhika_AchikanathChirakkara_CV.pdf) here.
